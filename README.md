## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains a machine learning solution for the famous  
**Titanic – Machine Learning from Disaster** competition on Kaggle.

The objective is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on demographic and travel-related features such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and family relationships.

This project demonstrates a **complete real-world ML workflow**, from raw data preprocessing to final Kaggle submission generation.
