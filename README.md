## 🎯 Overview

This project solves the classic **Titanic – Machine Learning from Disaster** problem from Kaggle.
The objective is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic shipwreck based on demographic
and travel-related features.

The solution follows a complete machine learning workflow including data preprocessing,
feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and Kaggle submission generation.
